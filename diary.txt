Wednesday agenda:

- C++: Abstract Policy class, write a DummyPolicy that just makes the worm wiggle
- C++: (protobuf byte stuffing + extracting image) get images sent over to python end, and plausible controls sent back
- After M simulation steps, flushed stored experience to db.

Alternating optimization:
Train exploration policy for M minibatches (control the robot to gather lossy samples)
Train E2C for N minibatches

some mix of past experiences and new experiences)

- set up a database to store observation X and U trajectories into database.

plane control
- run interactive search experiments with original E2C parameters (2 action dimensions, 1 temporal)
- run interactive search with multi-step E2C (2 action dimensions, 10 temporal)

List of experiments to run:
- add spatial transformer to plane experiment, see if that improves things.
- add policy 

worm control
- implement simple policy that gets robot moving via gRPC
- train vanilla E2C on pre-computed worm data

Reach goals:
- headless simulation
- resnet


DISTRIBUTED SIMULATION:
- high-level coordinator script that implements high-level algorithm?
  - launches the simulation on some machine
  - launches E2C learning on one machine
  - launches policy learning on another machine (uses E2C model)



- TensorFlow running on brahe
- send data over
